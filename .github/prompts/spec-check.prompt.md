Please review this spec. Does it make sense? Does it contradict itself?  Is it overly redundant? Does it have what's needed to be implemented?

Please check against the existing codebase.

Add any questions you have for me in a `## Questions` section at the end of the document. Number the questions so they are easy to reference. I will fill out answers inline.
