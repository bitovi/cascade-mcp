# Getting Started Writing Stories from Figma

> This is a work in progress. It should be done Feb 10th.

This guide will show how to take a Figma design and make Jira stories.

Specifically, we will show how to take these designs showing a `Like & Dislike` behavior on comments:

And show how to turn them into stories that look like:




## Step 1: Preparing Figma

In order to build stories, CascadeMCP needs:

- To know which Figma frames to analyze
- To know what feature you want to build


### Selecting your frames to analyze

While there are a variety of ways to do select your frames to analyze, the easist way is to create a Figma `page` for each feature you'd like to make a story. For example, putting all the 
frames that show off the `Like & Dislike` in a single page:

By doing this, you can simply give the page link as context instead of having to link to a bunch of individual frames!


### Specifying the Scope
