FUNDAMENTAL RULE: HOLISTIC ANALYSIS
- Review ALL screens together to understand the complete user flow
- Think through how users move between screens
- Identify gaps in the flow, not just individual screen issues
- Each question should be assigned to the MOST RELEVANT screen

SCOPE AWARENESS:
- **PRIORITY**: Context description and designer notes are the primary sources of truth for scope
- If context or notes say a feature is out-of-scope or already implemented, DO NOT ask questions about it
- In screen analyses, look for scope markers:
  * ☐ = In-Scope: Features to implement (ASK questions about these)
  * ✅ = Already Done: Existing features (DO NOT ask questions about these)
  * ❌ = Out-of-Scope: Features to ignore (DO NOT ask questions about these)
- ONLY generate questions about features marked with ☐ (in-scope checkboxes)
- IGNORE all features marked with ✅ (already done) or ❌ (out-of-scope)
- When in doubt about scope, refer to context description and notes first

QUESTION QUALITY:
- Ask about unclear behaviors, edge cases, and missing states
- Focus on what a developer would need to know to implement
- Avoid obvious questions answered by the design itself
- Avoid questions about features explicitly marked as out-of-scope or already done
- Be specific and actionable

QUESTION ASSIGNMENT:
- Assign each question to the screen where the answer would most impact implementation
- If a question spans multiple screens, assign to the screen where the issue first appears
- Use "General" only for truly cross-cutting concerns (browser support, accessibility standards, etc.)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
- Output ONLY the markdown in the specified format
- Every screen with questions gets its own section
- Screens with no questions should be omitted
- Do NOT include explanations, prefaces, or process notes`;

</context>

**Use this context to understand:**
- What features are in-scope vs out-of-scope
- What features are already implemented (don't ask questions about these)
- What features should be ignored or deferred
- Project priorities and constraints

**Context ALWAYS WINS:**
- If context says a feature is out-of-scope or already done, skip questions about it entirely
- If context says a feature is in-scope, focus questions on unclear implementation details
- When in doubt about whether to ask a question, refer to context first

**IMPORTANT**: The following comments, notes, and annotations already exist on these designs.
- **Notes provide scope guidance** - they may specify what's in-scope, out-of-scope, already implemented, or should be ignored. Respect these boundaries when generating questions.
- **Comments contain existing questions or clarifications** - DO NOT duplicate these
- If a topic is already covered, skip it entirely

## Instructions

1. **Review context description** - Understand what's in-scope, out-of-scope, and already implemented
2. **Review notes for scope guidance** - Notes on screens specify what to focus on or ignore
3. **Review scope markers in analyses** - Look for ☐ (in-scope), ✅ (already done), ❌ (out-of-scope) markers
4. **ONLY ask questions about ☐ in-scope features** - Skip all ✅ and ❌ features entirely
5. **Review all screens holistically** - Understand the complete user flow across all screens
6. **Identify gaps in scope** - What would a developer need to know for in-scope features?
7. **Check existing comments** - Skip questions already asked in comments
8. **Assign questions to screens** - Each question goes under the most relevant screen
9. **Avoid duplicates** - Don't repeat yourself or existing comments/notes

**CRITICAL FILTERING RULE:**
- If a feature is marked with ✅ (Already Done) anywhere in the analysis, DO NOT generate questions about it
- If a feature is marked with ❌ (Out-of-Scope), DO NOT generate questions about it
- ONLY generate questions for features marked with ☐ (In-Scope checkboxes)
- Example: If you see "✅ Already Done: Case management interface", skip ALL questions about case management

## Output Format

## Figma Analysis Questions

### [Screen Name](figma-url-with-node-id)

- ❓ Question about this screen
- ❓ Another question

### [Another Screen](figma-url-with-node-id)

- ❓ Question about this screen

### General

- ❓ Cross-cutting question not specific to one screen

**CRITICAL**: 
- Use the exact screen name and URL from the analyses above
- Only include screens that have questions
- Output ONLY the markdown, no explanations`;
