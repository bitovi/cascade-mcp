# Contributing to Jira MCP Auth Bridge

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you set up the project locally and configure it to work with your own Atlassian app credentials.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v9 or higher recommended)
- An Atlassian developer account ([developer.atlassian.com](https://developer.atlassian.com/))

## 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitovi/jira-mcp-auth-bridge.git
cd jira-mcp-auth-bridge
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Create an Atlassian OAuth App

You must register a new OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app in the Atlassian Developer Console to obtain credentials for local development.

### Steps:
1. Go to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/).
2. Click **Create app** > **OAuth 2.0 integration**.
3. Enter an app name (e.g., `Jira MCP Auth Bridge Local`).
4. Set the **Redirect URL** to:
   - `http://localhost:3000/callback`
5. Add the following **OAuth scopes**:
   - `read:jira-work`
   - `write:jira-work`
   - `offline_access`
6. Save the app and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 4. Create a Figma OAuth App (Optional - for Figma Integration)

If you plan to use the Figma integration features (like creating shell stories from Figma designs), you'll need to set up a Figma OAuth app.

### Steps:
1. Go to [Figma Developer Portal](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps) and sign in.
2. Click **Create new app**.
3. Enter an app name (e.g., `Jira MCP Auth Bridge Local`).
4. Set the **Redirect URI** to:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/figma`
5. Add the following **OAuth scopes**:
   - `file_content:read` (to read Figma file content)
   - `file_comments:read` (to read Figma file comments)
6. Save the app and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
7. Add these to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=your-figma-client-id-here
   FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-figma-client-secret-here
   FIGMA_OAUTH_SCOPES="file_content:read,file_comments:read"
   ```
8. Optionally, add an icon and description, and publish the app to your local organization

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Fill in the following variables in your `.env` file using the values from your Atlassian app:
   - `VITE_JIRA_CLIENT_ID` (from Atlassian Developer Console)
   - `JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET` (from Atlassian Developer Console)
   - `VITE_JIRA_CALLBACK_URL` (should be `http://localhost:3000/callback`)
   - `VITE_JIRA_SCOPE` (should be `read:jira-work write:jira-work offline_access`)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` (set to random secure strings for local dev)

3. If you set up Figma integration, also add the Figma credentials:
   - `FIGMA_CLIENT_ID` (from Figma Developer Portal)
   - `FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET` (from Figma Developer Portal)
   - `FIGMA_OAUTH_SCOPES` (should be `"file_content:read,file_comments:read"`)

Example:
```env
VITE_JIRA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
VITE_JIRA_APP_KEY=your-app-key-here
VITE_JIRA_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/callback
VITE_JIRA_SCOPE="read:jira-work write:jira-work offline_access"
SESSION_SECRET=changeme_in_dev
JWT_SECRET=changeme_in_dev

# Optional Figma integration
FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=your-figma-client-id-here
FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-figma-client-secret-here
FIGMA_OAUTH_SCOPES="file_content:read,file_comments:read"
```

## 6. Run the App Locally

```bash
npm run start-local
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 7. Testing Token Expiration (Optional)
To test token refresh flows, you can force short-lived tokens:
```bash
TEST_SHORT_AUTH_TOKEN_EXP=60 npm run start-local
```

## 8. Running Integration Tests (Optional)
See the `README.md` and `specs/` directory for integration test instructions.

## 9. Contributing Code
- Please follow the code style and documentation patterns in the repo.
- Update `server/readme.md` with any API or file changes.
- Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
