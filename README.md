Jira MCP Auth Bridge provides an MCP service that enables fetching images from a Jira work item.
Furthermore, it proxies Jira's authorization flow, enabling agents to be authorized through webpage redirects.

Jira already supports an [RPC service](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/remote-mcp-server).  However, it doesn't support all of Jira's capabilities. This is why we built this project.
