# Specification Quality Checklist: Static Pre-Generated Encryption Keys

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All quality checks passed successfully.

**Specification Quality**:

- User stories are properly prioritized (P1-P4) with independent test cases
- All 20 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (no mention of specific technologies)
- Assumptions section clearly documents decisions and constraints
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are sufficiently detailed

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
